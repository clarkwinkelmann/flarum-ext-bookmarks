This extension lets user bookmark discussions.

Bookmarked discussions have a badge and appear under the additional bookmarks page.

Bookmarked discussions work similarly to Followed discussions, but don't have any notification system linked to them.

A single setting lets you customize whether you want the control to be accessible in the discussion side navigation like the subscription, or only in the discussion dropdown.

## Installation

See https://github.com/clarkwinkelmann/flarum-ext-discussion-bookmarks for the new releases

## Support

This extension is under **minimal maintenance**.

It was developed for a client and released as open-source for the benefit of the community.
I might publish simple bugfixes or compatibility updates for free.

You can [contact me](https://clarkwinkelmann.com/flarum) to sponsor additional features or updates.

Support is offered on a "best effort" basis through the Flarum community thread.
